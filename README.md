This is a game developed from the concept off a lecture. It is aimed at rolling dice from two users on either sides of the screen. 
It is developed using JS, CSS and HTML. For each dice rolled, the active user gets a cummulative score and keps rolling until they want to hold the score they have presently which is added to their main score or when they roll a 1 which automatically resets all of the cumulative score and passes the round to the second player.
The computer Mode was also recently executed. Where a player can chose to play against computer. This was a bit difficult to execute and is still a work in progress. As it is the computer playing several rounds happens all within milliseconds and trying to slow the process has resulted to bugs. However, more research would be done and the game would be further developed.
