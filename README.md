# pig-game
This is a game developed from the concept off a lecture on udemy by Jonas Schmidtman. It is aimed at rolling dice from two users on either sides of the screen. 
It is developed using JS and for each dice rolled, the active user gets a cummulative score and keps rolling until they want to hold the score they have presently which is added to their main score or when they roll a 1 which automatically resets all of the cumulative score and passes the round to the second player.
the css and html files are nt novel files and are boiler plates from jonas schmidtmann.
